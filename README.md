# Draco - A Wenyan-lang IDE | Winner of NUS Hack and Roll 2025 Top 8! 🏆

## About Draco

**Draco** is an immersive IDE designed specifically for **[Wenyan-lang](https://github.com/wenyan-lang/wenyan)**, a traditional Chinese programming language. Created by three friends from diverse cultural backgrounds—our goal was to embrace and celebrate this unique culture through code.

## Features

Draco offers a fully immersive development environment with traditional Chinese aesthetics and functionality:

- 📝 **Dedicated Wenyan-lang IDE** – Write and execute Wenyan-lang code seamlessly.
- 🎨 **Authentic Chinese UI** – Experience a visually rich interface inspired by traditional Chinese calligraphy.
- 🈹 **Top-down, right-to-left text flow** – Emulating classical Chinese writing styles.
- ✨ **Syntax highlighting** – Dynamic and static syntax highlighting with Prism.js integration.
- 🌗 **Light/Dark mode** – Choose the theme that best suits your preference.
- 🎁 **Easter Egg (Ctrl + A)** – Try it and see what happens! 😉

## How We Built It

We built Draco using **Wenyan-lang itself, Javascript, HTML and CSS**. Our goal was to blend traditional aesthetics with modern web development techniques.

**Key technologies used:**
- HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (ES6+)
- Wenyan-lang for code execution
- Prism.js for syntax highlighting

## Challenges We Faced

Creating Draco wasn't without its hurdles. Some of the key challenges we tackled include:

- **Text Direction Handling:** Adapting to top-down, right-to-left text orientation posed significant UI challenges, requiring custom solutions beyond existing libraries.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Initially, we wanted to create our own solution but we managed hacky ways that work instead, tapping on Prism.js for efficiency.
- **Cultural Exploration:** Ensuring authenticity while making Draco user-friendly for a global audience.

## What We Learned

Throughout this journey, we gained:

- A deeper understanding of engineering an app without relying on pre-built libraries and components.
- Insights into Wenyan-lang.
- Our first hackathon experience together!
- A stronger tolerance for an absence of sleep and staring at a screen for extended hours.
